    "# Human in the loop\n",
    "\n",
    "Human-in-the-loop (HITL) patterns for AI agents fall into a few broad categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Approval Gates\n",
    "The agent pauses before executing high-stakes or irreversible actions, waiting for human confirmation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Financial transactions or purchases\n",
    "- Contractual agreement execution\n",
    "- Sending emails/messages on behalf of the user\n",
    "- Modifying production systems or databases\n",
    "- Deleting or overwriting data\n",
    "\n",
    "###  2. Ambiguity Resolution\n",
    "The agent encounters uncertainty and escalates to a human for clarification rather than guessing:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Underspecified user intent (\"schedule a meeting\" — with whom? when?)\n",
    "- Multiple valid interpretations of a request\n",
    "- Missing context the agent can't infer\n",
    "- Edge cases not covered by the agent's instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Quality Assurance\n",
    "Human reviews agent outputs before they're finalized or delivered:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reviewing generated content before publishing\n",
    "- Validating research findings or summaries\n",
    "- Checking code changes before committing\n",
    "- Approving customer-facing responses\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Error Recovery / Correction\n",
    "Human intervention when the agent gets stuck or makes mistakes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Agent hits a dead end and needs guidance\n",
    "- Correcting factual errors or hallucinations\n",
    "- Recovering from tool failures\n",
    "- Redirecting when the agent misunderstands the goal\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Policy/Judgment Calls\n",
    "Decisions that require human values, ethics, or domain expertise the agent shouldn't make autonomously:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Prioritization decisions with competing stakeholders\n",
    "- Situations with legal or compliance implications\n",
    "- Novel situations outside the agent's training distribution\n",
    "- Anything requiring organizational authority\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Costs of HITL interrupts:\n",
    "Human in the loop interrupts must be used thoughtful to not destroy productivity gains:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Latency** — Human response time becomes the bottleneck; defeats the point if you're waiting hours for approval on routine tasks\n",
    "- **Scalability**  — Can't run N agents in parallel if each needs human attention; you become the limiting factor\n",
    "- **Context switching** — Humans get interrupt fatigue, make worse decisions when constantly pulled in\n",
    "- **Defeats autonomy** — Too many checkpoints and you've just built a fancy todo list, not an agent"
