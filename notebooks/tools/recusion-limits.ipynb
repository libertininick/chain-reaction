    "# Limiting Agent Recursion Depth\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several practical reasons to cap agent iterations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Preventing infinite loops**: Agents can get stuck in cycles where they repeatedly call the same tool without making progress. This often happens when:\n",
    "    - The model misinterprets tool outputs and keeps retrying the same approach\n",
    "    - A tool returns an error the model doesn't know how to handle\n",
    "    - The prompt or task is ambiguous, causing the agent to loop trying different interpretations\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Cost control**: Each iteration involves an LLM call (and potentially API calls to external tools). An agent stuck in a loop can rack up significant token costs quickly. A recursion limit acts as a financial circuit breaker.\n",
    "3. **Latency bounds**: For user-facing applications, you need predictable response times. An unbounded agent could take minutes or longer to respond. Setting a limit lets you guarantee worst-case latency and provide feedback like \"I couldn't complete this task in the allowed steps.\"\n",
    "4. **Adversarial robustness**: Malicious prompts can try to trick agents into looping forever. The recursion limit is a safety net against prompt injection attacks that attempt to hijack the agent's execution.\n",
    "5. **Debugging and observability**: When an agent hits the limit, it's a clear signal something went wrong. You can inspect the intermediate steps to understand why the agent didn't converge on a solution, which is much easier to debug than an agent that runs indefinitely. In practice, most well-designed agent tasks should complete in 3-10 iterations. If you're consistently hitting limits, it usually indicates a problem with your tool definitions, prompts, or task decomposition rather than a need for more iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Defining recursion limit\n",
    "- In LangChain >= 1.0, `create_agent` builds a LangGraph-based agent, so iteration limits are controlled via `recursion_limit`\n",
    "- The default `recursion_limit` is 25. \n",
    "- Each agent \"iteration\" (model call → tool execution) typically consumes 2 graph steps\n",
    "- If you want N tool-calling iterations, set `recursion_limit` to roughly `1 + 2 * num_tool_calls + 1`\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to set this:\n",
    "1. Set as a default on the agent using .with_config():\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    agent = create_agent(\n",
    "        model=\"your-model\",\n",
    "        tools=tools,\n",
    "        system_prompt=\"You are a helpful assistant.\"\n",
    "    ).with_config({\"recursion_limit\": 50})\n",
    "\n",
    "    result = agent.invoke({\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"...\"}]})\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Pass at runtime when invoking:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    agent = create_agent(model=\"your-model\", tools=tools)\n",
    "\n",
    "    result = agent.invoke(\n",
    "        {\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"...\"}]},\n",
    "        config={\"recursion_limit\": 50}\n",
