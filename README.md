# chain-reaction ⚡

My incremental journey learning to create agentic workflows with LangChain and LangGraph.

## About

Working through [DeepLearning.AI's LangChain courses](https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/?courses_date_desc%5Bquery%5D=LangChain) to build hands-on experience with:
- [ ] [LangChain fundamentals](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/langchain-for-llm-application-development/)
- [ ] [Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/langchain-chat-with-your-data/)
- [ ] [Functions, Tools and Agents](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/functions-tools-agents-langchain/)
- [ ] [AI Agents in LangGraph](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/ai-agents-in-langgraph/)
- [ ] [Long-Term Agentic Memory](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/long-term-agentic-memory-with-langgraph/)

Each course or concept gets its own directory with dedicated experiments and notes.

## Setup

Using `uv` for Python environment management:
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone git@github.com:libertininick/chain-reaction.git
cd chain-reaction

# Install uv
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Install dependencies
uv sync
```
