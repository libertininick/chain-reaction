# LangGraph Fundamentals

LangGraph is a framework built on top of LangChain for creating stateful, agentic workflows. Workflows are defined as a graph of nodes and edges. Nodes represent different steps or agents and edges represent the flow between them. LangGraph is useful for building complex LLM applications that need to maintain state, handle cycles, support human-in-the-loop interactions, or coordinate multiple agents working together.
